Check for: each student has posted in:
- correct folders
- not missing posts (some multiple per day)
- all have been responded to
- average post lag 
- NO MULTIPOSTING FOR ONE DAY! (woohoo)
- video Observation credit
- video observation RESPONSES

Common reasons we didn/t find ur post:
- wrong title (format, date, etc)

End of summer survey:
- any days you didnt teach a section you normally would have OR any days you taught section on a day you didn't originally indicate?
- any other discrepancies? 
- anything else?

STUDENT POSTS
if (teaching_today):
    VLOOKUP # of posts supposed to make
    X/VLOOKUP posts made (search for name, then within that, search for date) (find a func to return array of nr of corresponding posts)
    count posts made
    if (all post for day made):
        "Done"
    else:
        "X posts left"

INSTRUCTOR RESPONSES
if (student_posts != "-"):
    fetch posts made so far and see if they have been responded to
